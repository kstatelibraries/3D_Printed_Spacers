  This repository contains 3D-printable designs for cube
  spacer components used in Hale Libraryâ€™s cube riser
  extensions. The STL and GLTF files provided support
  modular assembly at various angles and elevations,
  enabling custom configurations for display or structural
  setups. These models are intended for reuse, adaptation,
  and contribution within the Sunderland Innovation Lab,
  Kansas State Library, and larger K-State community and
  beyond.
