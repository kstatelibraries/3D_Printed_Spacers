## Manifest

This repository contains the following GLTF and STL files for 3D printing:

- spacer\_cube\_riser\_180 â€“ a spacer used for connecting two cube riser panels at the top
- spacer\_cube\_riser\_360 - a spacer used for end pieces of riser panels at the top
- spacer\_cube\_riser\_90\_0 - a spacer which connects a two panels at 90 degrees where one is slightly lower than the other
- spacer\_cube\_riser\_90\_1 - a spacer which connects two panels at any height
- spacer\_cube\_riser\_90\_2 - a spacer which is functionally the same as spacer\_cube\_riser\_90\_0, but with some embellishment triangles
